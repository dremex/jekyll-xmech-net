"Where?" was the most common response from people whenever Jamie and I mentioned our 4th of July road trip destination. Ten Sleep, Wyoming is a little town of ~300 people about 60 miles from Buffalo. A few miles outside of town lies Ten Sleep Canyon, boasting over 400 bolted sport routes on amazing pocketed and flaked limestone; the perfect place to spend an extended holiday weekend.

### July 2nd

Looking forward to a week of camping and climbing we packed up the truck, loaded the dogs, and started our seven hour drive.

Somewhere between I-80 and Kemmerer we lost cell phone reception for what turned out to be most of the trip. Luckily Jamie had printed google map directions but it turns out that you have to be paying attention to road signs when you don't have GPS turn by turn directions... Three hours into our drive we found ourselves off course but next to Fontenelle Reservoir where we stopped to stretch our legs and let the dogs play in the water.

Eventually we arrived at our camp near the mouth of the canyon. Jamie and I prefer "dispersed camping" (camping outside of a normal campground) and we managed to find a beautiful secluded spot with a river just a short stroll away.

After setting up camp we spent the rest of the day relaxing in the water and building our patented rock walled pool.

### July 3rd

For our first day of climbing we intended to visit "[Circus Wall](http://mountainproject.com/v/circus-wall/105856754 "Circus Wall"){:target="_blank"}" so we packed up our gear and hit the road. Often finding the crag is the most difficult part of climbing; the directions consisted of the following: "Best access from the 5th pullout (on the right)". Shortly after parking in what we hoped to be the 5th pullout another car parked next to us but before we could ask them if this was the correct place they yelled out our names! Surprised, it took us a second to realize these were climbing friends from home! What are the odds of running into people you know, 7+ hours away, looking for the exact same crag?

After a "what are you doing here?" and some hellos we all determined that we were in the right place and started our hike up to the wall. It turns out that the 4th of July weekend is a popular time to be climbing in Ten Sleep and the bottom of Circus Wall was packed so we decided to warm up on some short 5.10a's at Raven Wall.
